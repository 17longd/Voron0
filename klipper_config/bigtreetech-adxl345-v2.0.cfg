# This file contains common pin mappings for the bigtreetech adxl345 v2.0
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# RP2040 with "USB"
# The micro-controller will be used to control the components on the nozzle.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
#Below can always be included
[shaketune]
# result_folder: ~/printer_data/config/ShakeTune_results
#    The folder where the results will be stored. It will be created if it doesn't exist.
# number_of_results_to_keep: 4
#    The number of results to keep in the result_folder. The oldest results will
#    be automatically deleted after each runs.
# keep_raw_csv: False
#    If True, the raw CSV files will be kept in the result_folder alongside the
#    PNG graphs. If False, they will be deleted and only the graphs will be kept.
# show_macros_in_webui: True
#    Mainsail and Fluidd doesn't create buttons for "system" macros that are not in the
#    printer.cfg file. If you want to see the macros in the webui, set this to True.
# timeout: 300
#    The maximum time in seconds to let Shake&Tune process the CSV files and generate the graphs.
